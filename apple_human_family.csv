4,"I don't know if this is a good sign for this commercial or not, but whenever it comes on, the only thing I can think about is how much I miss Maya Angelou.",1
5,"My goodness, with everything happening in America currently and the world around us- this needs to be played more often. “We are more alike my friends than unalike” we have more in comment than what decides us,. Learn  to speak to another human being instead always watching the news to educate you on both sides, you will discover that we do have more in comment. Blessings to all!",1

18,"As a black person myself, I ask this! If we were really more alike than unalike, then where are our hospitals? Where are our gas stations? Where are our supermarkets? Where are our industrial trade unions? Where are our distribution networks? Where are our banks and credit unions? Where are our business loans? Where are our private and independent residential schools and school boards? Where are our own police departments? Where is our economic base? Stop making racism so damn emotional because it's not! Prejudice is emotional, attitudes are emotional, but true racism is a POWER relationship! ",1

29,"White is not bad.  Black is not bad.  Japenese are not bad.  Just like U.S.A is not bad.  We think different thoughts.  Though they can be the same.  We can both hold hands without having heart attacks.  Sometimes,  Blacks do bad things.  Just like whites.  No race is worse than the other.  Unless you make it that way.  We are all the same.  With different looks,  personalitys,  and traits.",9
