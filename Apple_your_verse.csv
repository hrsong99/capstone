10,One of the all time great commercials. The message is so true and delivered expressively. There’s even a quote from Walt Whitman. I’m guessing this why so many English students are watching this.

Robin Williams gave it a voice and a place in the American conscience 30 years ago, and Apple made that all into art.  This work is a continually evolving work of Americana.  Please, PLEASE don’t just think of it as a grade.  This came to you from 150 years of emotion and inspiration.  Whitman, Williams and Jobs are all gone now, but this is still here.
