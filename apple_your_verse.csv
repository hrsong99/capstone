Learn  to speak to another human being instead always watching the news to educate you on both sides, you will discover that we do have more in comment. Blessings to all!",2,positive,0.5340039134025574

18,"As a black person myself, I ask this! If we were really more alike than unalike, then where are our hospitals? Where are our gas stations? Where are our supermarkets? Where are our industrial trade unions? Where are our distribution networks? Where are our banks and credit unions? Where are our business loans? Where are our private and independent residential schools and school boards? Where are our own police departments? Where is our economic base? Stop making racism so damn emotional because it's not! Prejudice is emotional, attitudes are emotional, but true racism is a POWER relationship! ",2,neutral,0.659670352935791
