I can't say how it is beautiful by its design , it makes the new change from the previous version to become modern nowadays until 2018 iPad Pro. Unfortunately it now needs battery replacement as it drains a lot of battery % faster than before, even with being less used. It still works as brand new, even home and sleep/wake button which are heavily used. Now I have an iPad Pro 9.7"" from 2016, which reminds me of the iPad Air 1 design, expect it has 4 speakers and a flashlight (which I don't always need at all).
